# ui-code-highlight

> Code highlighting in Ember-CLI apps using the `highlight.js` library

## Installation

````bash
ember install ui-code-highlight
````

The above assumes you're using a modern version of [Ember-CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com/) (aka, 0.2.3 or later). If you are not then just use:

````bash
npm install ui-code-highlight --save-dev
ember g ui-code-highlight
````

## Overview / Usage

Provides two components:

- code-block
- code-reference

Both are intended to leverage **highlight.js**'s rich library of languages to HTML'ize your code fragments in a useful way. Check out the demo for more info.

## Version Compatibility
